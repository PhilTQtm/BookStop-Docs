Seriously, before you start configuring the system, grab a pen and some paper and give some thought 
on how to structure your offering. Some time spent here will pay large dividends later.

## Resources

A 'Resource' is something that is bookable, it could be yourself, another person, a room, a vehicle 
or something else. 
List everything you need to be bookable.

## Booking Types

A 'Booking Type' dictates how an individual resource can be booked at a high level, it could be an 
appointment for a person, a package for a room, a duration such as a day or a weekend for a vehicle. 
Consider how each of your bookable resources can be booked out.

## Price Bands

A 'Price Band' dictates the potential costs associated with a booking type. It can include both 
compulsary and optional elements along with minimum and maximum quantaties. 
List prices applicable for each booking type, adding in selectable options too.

## Slot Templates

A 'Slot Template' facilitates a shortcut for quickly creating bookable slots for a Resource/Booking Type.
You define the days of the week, work day start and end time, slot duration and change-over time.
You then create bookable slots by applying a date range to the template. 
Consider your repeating booking patterns that will benefit from templates.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Adding appropriate answers to questions in the FAQ can save many phone calls, emails and more 
importantly, time, by allowing potential customer to self-service. Your site FAQ can be sub-divided 
into headed sections to address all common areas such as operating policies, opening hours, 
disclaimers, etc. Consider all the typical questions you receive and write comprehensive answers.

## An Example

We operate a free play arcade, we open Friday through Sunday and offer private parties Monday through 
Thursday. We would like to offer online booking of parties during the week and online booking for 
general admission during the weekend.

#### Resources 

The arcade is one building and technically one resource, but for this purpsose we will create two 
resources to allow different booking types and pricing to be attached.

- Ark Arcade Public Sessions
- Ark Arcade Private Parties

#### Booking Types

We now consider how each resource can be booked. Public Sessions are a one-time fee for a wrist band 
with price bands delimited on age, so we have a single booking type:

- General Admission

Private parties offer several options for catered / non-catered, with price bands per person and 
opotional elements such as meal size upgrades and extra hours, so we have two booking types:

- Catered Private Party
- Non-catered Private Party

#### Price Bands

General Admission prices are based on the common Child, Adult, Concession structure so we define 
those into a price band:

- General Admission Prices
    1. Child, Price £5.00, Min Qty 0, Max Qty 8
    1. Adult, Price, £10.00, Min Qty 0, Max Qty 8
    1. Concession, Price £7.50, Min Qty 0, Max Qty 8

Private parties are structured differently so require different price bands, for illustration 
purposes we just define the Catered Party:

- Catered Party
    1. Guest, Price £15.00, Min Qty 20, Max Qty 50
    1. Supersize, Price £5.00, Min Qty 0, Max Qty 50
    1. Extra hour, Price £100, Min Qty 0, Max Qty 1
