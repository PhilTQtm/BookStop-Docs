## OMG Yet Another Booking System...

Yes it true, this is yet another booking system, the internet is full of them.  

**In our defence:**  

The majority of them are calendar based single slot booking with limited flexibility. 
When we went looking for a booking system for our venue, (a familiy entertainment centre) 
to handle parties initially, we found many were pretty terrible, many more were just too basic, 
the majority could not support our required feature set, and those that could were extortionately 
expensive (total cost of service - 4 digits - per month!).  

So we built our own.
